<p>
The grade you compute is the starting point for course staff, who reserve the right to change the grade if they disagree with your assessment and to deduct points for other issues they may encounter, such as errors in the submission process, naming issues, etc.
</p>

<p>
The rule for grading forms is this: If you indicate that you have done a task on the grading form and you have not actually done the task, the TA will deduct double the number of points.
